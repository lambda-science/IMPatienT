        <h3>IMPatienTüóÇÔ∏èÔ∏è Abstract</h3>
        <p align="justify">
            <strong>Background</strong>
            <br/>
            Medical acts, such as imaging, generally lead to the production of several medical text reports that
            describe the
            relevant findings. Such processes induce multimodality in patient data by linking image data to free-text
            data and
            consequently, multimodal data have become central to drive research and improve diagnosis of patients.
            However, the
            exploitation of patient data is challenging as the ecosystem of available analysis tools is fragmented
            depending on
            the type of data (images, text, genetic sequences), the task to be performed (digitization, processing,
            exploration)
            and the domain of interest (clinical phenotype, histology‚Ä¶). To address the challenges, the analysis tools
            need to
            be integrated in a simple, comprehensive, and flexible platform.
            <br/>
            <strong>Results</strong>
            <br/>
            Here, we present IMPatienT (<strong>I</strong>ntegrated digital <strong>M</strong>ultimodal
            <strong>PATIEN</strong>t
            da<strong>T</strong>a), a free and open-source web application to digitize, process and explore multimodal
            patient
            data. IMPatienT has a modular architecture, including four components to: (i) create a standard vocabulary
            for a
            domain, (ii) digitize and process free-text data by mapping it to a set of standard terms, (iii) annotate
            images and
            perform image segmentation, and (iv) generate an automatic visualization dashboard to provide insight on the
            data
            and perform automatic diagnosis suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of IMPatienT on a corpus
            of 40
            simulated muscle biopsy reports of congenital myopathy patients.
            <br/>
            <strong>Conclusions</strong>
            <br/>
            IMPatienT is a platform to digitize, process and explore patient data that can handle image and free-text
            data. As
            it relies on a user-designed vocabulary, it can be adapted to fit any domain of research and can be used as
            a
            patient registry for exploratory data analysis (EDA). A demo instance of the application is available at <a

            The MYO-xIA project aims to collect data from patients with
            <strong>congenital myopathies</strong> in order to analyse them using
            <strong>explainable AI approaches</strong>. In the field of congenital
            myopathies research, there is an important need for
            <strong>digitization and standardization of patient data</strong> in order
            to use modern data analysis methods.<br/>This project has tree mains
            objectives:

        <br/>
        <ul align="justify">
            <li>
                <strong>Gather and format patient data</strong> to be ready for automatic
                exploitation (patient histology-report form, image annotation, OCR/NLP)

            <li>
                Provide tools for <strong>automatic diagnosis</strong> based on patient
                data (live prediction of congenital myopathy subtype with histology
                reports, images, genetic data and phenotype)
