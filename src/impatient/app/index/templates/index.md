# IMPatienT üóÇÔ∏è: an integrated web application to digitize, process and explore multimodal patient data.

**IMPatienT** üóÇÔ∏è is a web application developped in the **MYO-xIA project** for patient data digitization and
exploration.
It features a standard vocabulary creator, optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), image
annotation and segmentation using machine learning, interactive visualizations and automatic diagnosis prediction.

## Demo Usage Instructions

The application is preloaded with a database of histology reports and a standard vocabulary for muscle biopsy. Data on
this demo instance is reset once every day.
For the PDF automatic analysis, you can find a sample
PDF [HERE](https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/IMPatienT/sample_demo_report.pdf) working with the preinstalled standard
vocabulary. A sample image for image annotation can be
found [HERE](https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/IMPatienT/sample_image_histo.jpg).

## Partners

IMPatienT is developped and used in collaboration with
the [Morphological Unit of the Institute of Myology of Paris](https://www.institut-myologie.org/en/recherche-2/neuromuscular-investigation-center/morphological-unit/).
A production instance is deployed to help discovering new relevant features for congenital myopathies classification and
diagnosis.

## IMPatienTüóÇÔ∏è Abstract

**Background**
Medical acts, such as imaging, generally lead to the production of several medical text reports that describe the
relevant findings. Such processes induce multimodality in patient data by linking image data to free-text data and
consequently, multimodal data have become central to drive research and improve diagnosis of patients. However, the
exploitation of patient data is challenging as the ecosystem of available analysis tools is fragmented depending on the
type of data (images, text, genetic sequences), the task to be performed (digitization, processing, exploration) and the
domain of interest (clinical phenotype, histology‚Ä¶). To address the challenges, the analysis tools need to be integrated
in a simple, comprehensive, and flexible platform.
**Results**
Here, we present IMPatienT (d**I**gitize **M**ultimodal **PATIEN**t da**T**a), a free and open-source web application to
digitize, process and explore multimodal patient data. IMPatienT has a modular architecture, including four components
to: (i) create a standard vocabulary for a domain, (ii) digitize and process free-text data by mapping it to a set of
standard terms, (iii) annotate images and perform image segmentation, and (iv) generate an automatic visualization
dashboard to provide insight on the data and perform automatic diagnosis suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate the
usefulness of IMPatienT on a corpus of 40 simulated muscle biopsy reports of congenital myopathy patients.
**Conclusions**
IMPatienT is a platform to digitize, process and explore patient data that can handle image and free-text data. As it
relies on a user-designed vocabulary, it can be adapted to fit any domain of research and can be used as a patient
registry for exploratory data analysis (EDA). A demo instance of the application is available
at https://huggingface.co/spaces/corentinm7/IMPatienT.

## MYO-xIA Project

The MYO-xIA project aims to collect data from patients with **congenital myopathies** in order to analyse them using *
*explainable AI approaches**. In the field of congenital myopathies research, there is an important need for *
*digitization and standardization of patient data** in order to use modern data analysis methods.
This project has tree mains objectives:

- **Gather and format patient data** to be ready for automatic exploitation (patient histology-report form, image
  annotation, OCR/NLP)
- Help the **discovery of new phenotype-genotype-histology** association for each congenital myopathy subtype (standard
  vocabulary creation tool, per gene and per class histology feature statistics)
- Provide tools for **automatic diagnosis** based on patient data (live prediction of congenital myopathy subtype with
  histology reports, images, genetic data and phenotype)
